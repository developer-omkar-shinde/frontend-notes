# JAVASCRIPT INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

---

## ðŸš€ How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations, and what are the differences between callbacks, promises, and async/await?

## ðŸš€ Explain the event loop in JavaScript. How does it work with the call stack and callback queue?

- The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that enables its non-blocking, asynchronous behavior.

- The event loop continuously checks whether the call stack is empty and whether there are pending tasks in the callback queue or microtask queue.

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript?

- undefined is the default state of value. it automatically assign when verialble is declered.

- null is intentionally assign empty value. represent absence of value.

## ðŸš€ How does JavaScript handle memory management, and what is garbage collection?

- JavaScript automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation using Garbage Collection (GC). This means developers donâ€™t have to manually allocate or free memory, unlike languages like C or C++.

- Garbage Collection (GC) is the process of automatically detecting and freeing memory that is no longer in use to prevent memory leaks.

## ðŸš€ What is a closure in JavaScript, and why is it useful?

- A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

- In simple terms, a closure allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or environment even after that scope has closed.

## ðŸš€ What are the drawbacks of using closures?

## ðŸš€ How does JavaScript handle lexical scoping?

JavaScript follows a scope chain to resolve variables:

First, it checks the functionâ€™s local scope.
If not found, it looks in the parent scope (the outer function).
If still not found, it moves up the chain until reaching the global scope.
If not found anywhere, it throws a ReferenceError.

## ðŸš€ How can you use closures to create private variables in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between .map(), .filter(), and .reduce()?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between var, let, and const?

## ðŸš€ What is the spread/rest operator, and how is it useful?

## ðŸš€ What is destructuring, and how does it work with arrays and objects?

## ðŸš€ Explain the concept of optional chaining (?.) in JavaScript.

## ðŸš€ what is Prototype? Explain prototypal inheritance in JavaScript.

- The prototype allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects, reducing memory usage and improving code reusability.

- Prototypal inheritance is a feature in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects via the prototype chain.

## ðŸš€ How does the this keyword work in JavaScript? Provide examples of how this behaves in different contexts.

## ðŸš€ How would you optimize a JavaScript function to improve performance?

## ðŸš€ What is memoization, and how can you implement it in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ What are the different ways to manipulate the DOM in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ How would you implement infinite scrolling in vanilla JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?

## ðŸš€ How does JavaScript internally handle type coercion?

## ðŸš€ What are the different ways to clone an object in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ How does hoisting work in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ How do function expressions and function declarations differ in terms of hoisting?

## ðŸš€ What are the different types of scopes in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), and why is it used?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between an object and a Map in JavaScript?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between .call(), .apply(), and .bind()?

## ðŸš€ What is function composition?

## ðŸš€ What is the difference between a higher-order function and a pure function?

## ðŸš€How does localStorage differ from sessionStorage and cookies?
