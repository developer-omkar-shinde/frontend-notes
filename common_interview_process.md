## Interview Process for a React.js Developer in MNCs

MNCs typically have a structured interview process for hiring React.js developers. The process usually consists of multiple rounds that assess technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and overall fit for the company. Below is a typical interview process with detailed information:

## 1. Resume Screening & HR Discussion

The recruiter reviews your resume to check if your skills match the job role.

They may ask basic questions like:

Tell me about yourself.

Why do you want to join our company?

What is your notice period and expected salary?

Are you open to working from the office (if applicable)?

## 2. Online Coding Round (DSA + JavaScript)

Most MNCs require candidates to pass an online coding round on platforms like HackerRank, Codility, or LeetCode. Expect 2â€“3 DSA questions with a time limit of 60â€“90 minutes.

Common Topics:
âœ… Arrays & Strings
âœ… HashMaps & Sets
âœ… Recursion
âœ… Linked Lists
âœ… Trees & Graphs (basic BFS/DFS)
âœ… Sorting & Searching Algorithms

Example Questions:
Find the missing number in an array of size n-1 containing numbers from 1 to n.

Implement a function to check if two strings are anagrams.

Reverse a linked list.

Find the first non-repeating character in a string.

## 3. JavaScript & React.js Interview (Coding + Theoretical)

This round assesses your JavaScript fundamentals, React.js knowledge, and problem-solving skills.

JavaScript Questions:
Explain closures with an example.

How does this behave in different contexts?

Difference between map, filter, and reduce.

What is the event loop, and how does JavaScript handle async operations?

Implement a polyfill for bind() function.

Difference between deep copy and shallow copy?

What are promises and async/await?

How does JavaScript handle memory management (Garbage Collection)?

What is debouncing and throttling?

What happens when you compare two objects in JavaScript?

React.js Questions:
Explain React Reconciliation & Fiber Architecture.

What are React hooks, and how do they work?

Difference between useEffect, useMemo, and useCallback.

How does React handle state updates?

How would you optimize a React application?

What is server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js, and how does it work?

Explain the difference between Redux and Context API.

What is Suspense in React?

How does hydration work in Next.js?

What are React portals, and where do you use them?

Live Coding:
Build a custom hook (e.g., useFetch)

Create a React component with dynamic form fields

Implement infinite scrolling in React

Optimize a slow-rendering React component

## 4. System Design & Architecture (For Senior Roles)

For mid/senior-level React developers, there is usually a System Design round where you discuss how to build and scale a web application.

Topics Covered:
How would you design an e-commerce website using React and Next.js?

How to implement authentication in a React app (OAuth, JWT, Session-based auth)?

How would you handle real-time updates in a React app (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events)?

How do you design a scalable component library for a large team?

How does Code-Splitting and Lazy Loading work?

How do you manage state efficiently in a large React application?

## 5. Behavioral & HR Round

Tell me about a time when you solved a complex problem in React.

How do you handle conflicts in a team?

What is your approach to learning new technologies?

Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

Why should we hire you?

Final Thoughts
âœ… Prepare DSA (Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Sorting & Searching)
âœ… Revise JavaScript (Closures, Event Loop, Promises, Async/Await, Call/Bind/Apply)
âœ… Master React (Hooks, Performance Optimization, Next.js, Redux, Zustand)
âœ… Practice coding on LeetCode, CodeSignal, or HackerRank
âœ… Be ready to explain real-world projects and challenges youâ€™ve solved
