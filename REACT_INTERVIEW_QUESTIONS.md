## ðŸš€ What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it improve performance? âœ…

- The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). Instead of making direct changes to the real DOM, React updates the Virtual DOM first, calculates the differences, and then applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM.

Think of the Virtual DOM as a blueprint of the UI that React maintains in memory.

## ðŸš€ How the Virtual DOM Works in React?

React follows a three-step Reconciliation process to update the UI efficiently:

- Step 1 : Render Phase (Create Virtual DOM)  
  When the state or props change, React re-renders the component and creates a new Virtual DOM.
- Step 2 : Reconciliation (Diffing Algorithm)  
  React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a diffing algorithm to identify changes.
- Step 3 : Commit Phase (Update Real DOM)  
  React batch updates only the changed elements in the real DOM instead of re-rendering the entire page.

#### ðŸ’¡Key Points:

- React does not modify the entire DOM; it updates only the differences.
- React batches updates to optimize performance.
- Fiber Architecture powers this process in modern React (from React 16 onwards).

## ðŸš€ Explain the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components.

## ðŸš€ What are keys in React, and why are they important?

- In React, keys are special attributes used to identify elements in a list. They help React efficiently update the UI by tracking which items have changed, been added, or removed.

## ðŸš€ How do you prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) in React applications?

- Always sanitize and validate any user input before rendering it. Use libraries like DOMPurify to clean HTML content and remove malicious scripts.
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML - The dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if used improperly. Only use it when you fully trust the content and have sanitized it.
- If we are accepting any URL in input, validate is is valid URL.

```javascript
import DOMPurify from "dompurify";
const userInput = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>';
const safeHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```
